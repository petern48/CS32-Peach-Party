# CS-32-Peach-Party

A class project was focused on implementing polymorphism, inheritance, and data structures to create a mini game modeled off of Nintendo's Mario Party
<br/>
<br/>
A project skeleton was given, and I as the student implemented the Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp files.
